# GW-algorithm-to-identify-subnetworks

This repository contains the MATLAB coding of the GW algorithm, which is used to identify subnetworks (solve Prize-Collecting Steiner Tree Problem).

There are six MATLAB files in total: GW.m is the main code of GW algorithm; 
D_01_b.mat is a drug similarity network; Function_merge_cpn.m is a function in the GW growth phase to merge two components; 
Function_OutputDegree.m is a function to calculate the degrees of vertices; 
Function_StrongPrune2.m is a function of the strong pruning algorithm; 
Function_pdegree.m is a function used in the strong pruning process to calculate the prune degree; 
Function_solution is a function to calculate the quality of the identified subnetwork.

To run GW algorithm, put all the MATLAB files in the same document, and run GW.m.
